# NvChad config (v2.5)
> My NvChad configuration for NvChad 2.5
### What's configured?
- LSP for CSharp, Haskell, C/C++/Rust
- Debug adapter, technically for Haskell and C/C++/Rust, but I have only tested for C. The ones for C++ and Rust should use the same configs as C though.
- Unit testing for CSharp and Haskell
- Linting for CSharp and C/C++
### What's to be configured?
- Python probably (with all the belts and whistles, from LSP to linting to debugging)
- Unit testing for Rust (if readily available. I may learn to write one myself, but for now, I have other business)
