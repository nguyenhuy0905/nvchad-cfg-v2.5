# NvChad config (v2.5)
> My NvChad configuration for NvChad 2.5
### What's configured?
- LSP for CSharp, Haskell, C/C++/Rust, Python
- Debug adapter, technically for Haskell, C#, C/C++/Rust, Java, Python, but I have only tested for C and Python. The ones for C++ and Rust should use the same configs as C though. The one for Java doesn't seem to work properly for now, but that's probably due to skill issue.
- Unit testing for C#, Haskell, Python.
- Linting for CSharp, C/C++, Python, and more.
### What's to be configured?
- None for now. 
### Packages to download
> Note: almost all your packages should have been downloaded through mason. So you would want to go to `~/.local/share/nvim/mason/packages/[whatever package it is]/[the executable file]`
- GHCup (basically a Haskell version control utility)
